// Ported from CausewaybayGolang/typescript/src/engine/assets.ts (which in turn
// carries it over from that project's love2d Lua). Kept close to the original
// so a fix made there can still be read across; Causewaybay Hacker changes are
// marked where they occur.
/**
 * The art, and when it arrives.
 *
 * `crates/mkassets` has already done everything `love2d/src/assets.lua` does
 * at launch — keying the magenta studio backdrop out, cropping each character
 * to its ink and packing it into a 32x48 cell — so there is nothing to process
 * here. What is left is a scheduling problem the desktop build does not have:
 * the sixteen backgrounds are four megabytes and only one of them is on screen
 * at a time.
 *
 * So the sprites, which are a few kilobytes all together, are loaded up front
 * and the backgrounds are fetched the first time a street asks for one. A
 * background that has not arrived yet simply is not drawn, and `world.ts`
 * falls back to a flat sky for that frame; nothing waits.
