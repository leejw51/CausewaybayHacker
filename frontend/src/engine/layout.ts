 * The virtual canvas, ported from `love2d/src/layout.lua`.
 *
 * The game is authored against 1280x720, or 720x1280 turned on its side, and
 * every coordinate in the renderer is in those units. This module works out
 * how many of them fit in the window and what to multiply them by.
 *
 * The one rule worth keeping in mind: below a 2x fit the virtual canvas is
 * *grown* along the longer axis rather than letterboxed, up to half again the
 * design size. A landscape layout in a tall browser window gets a taller
 * playfield, not black bars — which is why `SCENE_H` and the panel heights in
 * the renderer are all computed from `vw`/`vh` rather than being constants.
